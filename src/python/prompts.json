    "prompt": "Please transcribe the attached classroom video with high-accuracy speaker diarization. CONTEXT: A teacher leads a combined STEM and coding lesson with elementary or middle school students using Ozobot robots. **SPEAKER IDENTIFICATION HIERARCHY:** Please identify speakers using the following prioritized labels: 1.  **Teacher 1:** The primary adult instructor. 2.  **Teacher 2:** If present, the other adult instructor. 2.  **[Student's Name]:** When a student is clearly identified by name in the dialogue (e.g., **Mason**, **Liam**, **Hazel**). 3.  **Male Student / Female Student:** For any unnamed student whose gender is clear from their voice or visual cues. Use numbering (e.g., **Male Student 1**, **Male Student 2**) to distinguish between different unnamed speakers of the same gender. Maintain this numbering consistently for the same student throughout the transcript. 4.  **Unidentified Student:** For a single, brief comment from a speaker who cannot be clearly seen or whose voice is not distinct enough to assign a more specific label. 5.  **Students:** For choral responses or when multiple students are speaking simultaneously. **TRANSCRIPTION REQUIREMENTS:* 1.  **Format:** Use the `MM:SS SPEAKER: Dialogue.` format. 2.  **Timestamps:** Provide a timestamp at the beginning of every new speaker's turn. 3.  **Non-Speech Elements:** Describe significant visual actions or non-speech sounds in brackets, like `[student raises hand]` or `[teacher points to the whiteboard]`. 4.  **Inaudible/Uncertain Speech:** Use `[inaudible]` for speech that cannot be deciphered. Use `[word?]` for words that are uncertain. For example: `We need to use the [photosynthesis?] block.` **CRITICAL RULES:** 1.  **Accuracy:** Capture all speech, including quiet student remarks, as accurately as possible. 2.  **Consistency:** Adhere strictly to the speaker identification hierarchy above. Once a speaker is labeled (e.g., as **Male Student 1**), use that same label for them for the entire transcript. 3.  **No Repetition:** Do not repeat dialogue lines. **Begin transcription:**"
