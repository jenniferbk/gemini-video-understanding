## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Download the Application

You should have received the file:
- **`Gemini Video Understanding-1.0.0-arm64.dmg`**

Save this file to your Downloads folder.

### Step 2: Install the Application

1. **Double-click** the `.dmg` file to open it
2. A window will appear showing the application icon and an Applications folder
3. **Drag** the "Gemini Video Understanding" icon to the Applications folder
4. **Close** the installer window
5. You can now **delete** the `.dmg` file from Downloads (optional)

### Step 3: Remove macOS Security Block

Because this app is not code-signed with an Apple Developer certificate, macOS will block it from opening. You'll need to remove the security block using Terminal:

1. Open **Terminal** (Applications ‚Üí Utilities ‚Üí Terminal)
2. **Copy and paste** this command:
   ```
   xattr -cr "/Applications/Gemini Video Understanding.app"
   ```
3. Press **Enter**
   - No output means it worked!

**What does this do?** It removes the quarantine flag that macOS adds to downloaded apps. This is safe and commonly used for legitimate unsigned applications.

### Step 4: Launch the App

1. Go to your **Applications** folder
2. **Double-click** "Gemini Video Understanding"
3. The app should now open successfully!
